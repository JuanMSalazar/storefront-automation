# storefront-automation

##### I have used Webdriver Manager which handles all the webdriver configuration. In order to run the test all that is needed is to run the class ###ShoppingCartE2ETest.java### located in storefront-automation/src/test/java/

##### The Page Object Pattern has been used to make the test easier to maintain.
